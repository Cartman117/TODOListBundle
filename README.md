TODOListBundle
==============

1. What is it ?
---------------

This project intend to propose a TODOList using local storage or Google Api Task.

This project is realised by [KÃ©vin PIGNOT](https://github.com/Cartman117) and [Olivier GOYON](https://github.com/ss-bb)

2. How to install it ?
----------------------

You need an Apache server and Symfony2. You'll also need a MySQL database and apply this script [schema.sql](https://github.com/Cartman117/TODOListBundle/blob/master/schema.sql)
to your mysql server, after creating your database.

For this you can use Vagrant [PHP-VM](https://github.com/willdurand-edu/php-vm) where the database, apache are already configured. But you will have to apply the SQL script.

Then you will have to configure Doctrine, to use your database in /app/config in Symfony2 :

    - parameters.yml
    - config.yml

Add the follwing code into your /app/config/routing.yml

<code>
todo_list:
    resource: "@TODOListBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
    prefix:   /
</code>

And this into your /app/config/security.yml
<code>
security:
    providers:
        in_memory:
            memory: ~

    firewalls:
        dev:
            pattern: ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
            security: false

        default:
            pattern:  ^/
            simple_preauth:
                authenticator: todolist_authenticator
            access_denied_handler: todolist_access_denied_handler

    access_control:
        - { path: ^/TODOList/oauth/callback$, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/TODOList/lists, roles: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY }
        - { path: ^/, roles: ROLE_HAS_TOKEN }
</code>

You must include [HappyR - GoogleApiBundle](https://github.com/HappyR/GoogleApiBundle) and add our Bundle into Symfony2 and register them in your AppKernel.php

3. How does it work ?
---------------------

You will have several pages to manage your tasks or your tasklists to create, update, get or delete them.

4. Issues
---------

It's not possible to destroy token after getting Authenticated when clicking on Exit link.
